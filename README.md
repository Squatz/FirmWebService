# FirmWebService
A small sinatra webservice

To run the service you'll need to have ruby, sinatra and json installed.
Run ruby main.rb in terminal and open localhost:4567 (or what port the terminal tells you).

When the service is running, you'll have to fill out all parameters to add a new firm to the list.
And if you wish to search, you have to provide the equvialent firm name.
